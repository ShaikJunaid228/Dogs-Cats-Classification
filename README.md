In this project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The process involves preparing the dataset by resizing images and extracting relevant features before feeding them into the SVM model for training. This approach leverages SVM's strength in separating classes with a clear margin, making it an ideal choice for distinguishing between dog and cat images. The final model is assessed through various performance metrics, demonstrating the potential of SVM in visual classification tasks.
